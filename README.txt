# Disable FastTravel if you're using this, otherwise they will fight over trying to set the speed.

This mod does not aim to introduce any changes to the game balance or mecahnics.

It is purely quality of life features.

The mod should aim to fit into the base game without looking like a mod.

**How to install**

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version 0.23.0
2. Run Unity Mod Manger and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous
3. Download the Bubble Tweaks mod
4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 5 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab

**FEATURES:**

	Implementation of the wonderful FastTravel mod
		also adds support for a speed scale for tactical "homm-style" combat
		settings are adjusted using the native game settings window (ugly unity mod manager go away!)
